Snake, based on the classic arcade game, is an open source canvas game. I'm hosting this on my website:
[Play Here: http://michaelxf.com/apps/snake](http://michaelxf.com/apps/snake)



## How To Play
Use the arrow keys or WASD to move your snake around. Eat the red apples to grow your snake and increase your score. Touching the edge of the screen will simply teleport you to the opposite side.

## Usage
This is a very simple canvas game. You can run these files with any server, such as: NodeJS, Apache, etc... I also used Flexbox and other CSS optimizations.
